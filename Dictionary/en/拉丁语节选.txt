==== The poet Horace contemplates an invitation ====

<code>
Maecenas and Vergil are inviting me today. What should I think? What should I respond?
If I do something wrong, they often admonish me and find fault with me; if I do not err, they praise me. What should I expect today?

</code>

The literary patron Maecenas and the poet Vergil have invited Horace to meet with them but without telling him the purpose of the visit.\\
文学赞助人Maecenas和诗人Vergil邀请Maecenas与他们见面，但没有告诉他此行的目的。

Horace was much concerned with how he was viewed by others; in the initial stages of his acquaintance with Maecenas and Vergil, he was somewhat unsure about their relationship.\\
Maecenas非常在意别人对他的看法；在与Maecenas和Vergil初识的阶段，他对他们的关系有些不确定。
