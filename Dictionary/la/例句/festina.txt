==== 座右铭 ====

Augustus deplored rashness in a military commander, he thought nothing less becoming in a well-trained leader than haste and rashness.\\
奥古斯都对军事指挥官的鲁莽深感遗憾，他认为一个训练有素的领导者不应该行事冒失急躁。

Accordingly, favourite sayings of his were：

  * Festīnā lentē.
  * Better a safe commander than a bold.
  * That which has been done well has been done quickly enough.

——The Roman historian Suetonius, in 《De vita Caesarum》

Certain gold coins minted for Augustus bore images of a crab and a butterfly to attempt an emblem for the adage. \\ 为了传达这一格言的含义，一些为奥古斯都铸造的金币刻有蟹和蝴蝶的图案。

The adage was popular in the Renaissance era and Shakespeare alluded to it repeatedly. \\ 这句谚语在文艺复兴时期很流行，莎士比亚反复提到它。

In Love's Labour's Lost, he copied the crab and butterfly imagery with the characters Moth and Armado.

The adage was a favourite of the influential judge, Sir Matthew Hale. \\ 这句谚语是颇具影响力的法官Matthew Hale爵士的最爱。

Sir Matthew Hale was naturally a quick man; yet, by much practice on himself, he subdued that to such a degree, that he would never run suddenly into any conclusion concerning any matter of importance. \\ Matthew Hale爵士天生就是个快性子。然而，他通过大量练习将这种敏捷性控制到适宜的程度，以至于在任何重要事项上都不会突然得出结论。

Festina Lente was his beloved motto, which he ordered to be engraved on the head of his staff, and was often heard to say that be had observed many witty men run into great errors, because they did not give themselves time to think… \\ “Festīnā lentē”是他钟爱的座右铭，他下令将其刻在手杖顶部，并经常说“可以观察到许多机智的人犯下大错，是因为没有给自己预留思考的时间”。

——Burnet主教《The Life and Death of Sir Matthew Hale》

The Onslow family of Shropshire has the adage as its motto, generating a pun upon the family name: "on-slow". \\ 萨洛普郡的Onslow家族将这句格言作为家族的座右铭，（慢慢来）“on-slow”与他们的姓氏“Onslow”产生了一种双关的效果。

Erasmus (whose books were published by Manutius) featured the phrase in his Adagia and used it to compliment his printer:

Aldus, making haste slowly, has acquired as much gold as he has reputation, and richly deserves both.\\
Aldus以忙而不乱的行事获得了与他声誉同样丰厚的财富，他对这两者都是当之无愧的。

——《Adagia》Erasmus在书中称赞他的出版商Manutius

==== 引用 ====

In Bram Stoker's 1897 novel Dracula, Dr. Van Helsing says of Count Dracula:

He has all along, since his coming, been trying his power, slowly but surely; that big child-brain of his is working.\\
自从他来了，就一直在缓慢但稳定地尝试自己的力量，他那颗孩童般的大脑在运转。

Well for us, it is, as yet, a child brain; for had he dared, at the first, to attempt certain things he would long ago have been beyond our power.\\
对我们来说，他的大脑现在还只是一个孩子。要是他就一开始敢于尝试某些事情，他早就超出了我们的能力范围。

However, he means to succeed, and a man who has centuries before him can afford to wait and to go slow. Festina lente may well be his motto.\\
无论如何，他打算成功，后面还有数世纪之久可以等待并缓慢前进，“Festīnā lentē”很可能是他的座右铭。

——Bram Stoker《德古拉》（1897年）范海辛博士谈到德古拉伯爵

Composer Arvo Pärt wrote Festina lente for strings and harp, in which some instruments play the melody at half-speed while others play it at double-speed, so the music is both fast and slow.\\
作曲家Arvo Pärt创作了一首名为《Festina lente》的弦乐和竖琴作品，其中一些乐器以半速演奏主旋律，而其他乐器以双倍速演奏，使得音乐既快又慢。

In physics, the name "Festina Lente Limit" has been applied to the Strong Confinement Limit, which is a mode of an atom laser in which the frequency of emission of the Bose–Einstein condensate is less than the confinement frequency of the trap.\\
在物理学中，“Festina Lente Limit”被用来指代强约束极限（Strong Confinement Limit）。这是一种原子激光模式，其中玻色-爱因斯坦凝聚体的发射频率小于陷阱的约束频率。

The French poet and critic Nicolas Boileau, in his Art poétique (The Art of Poetry) (1674) applied the dictum specifically to the work of the writer, whom he advised in those words:

Slowly make haste, and without losing courage;\\
Twenty times redo your work;\\
Polish and re-polish endlessly,\\
And sometimes add, but often take away.

缓慢而不失勇气地忙碌\\
二十次重复工作\\
无休止地打磨再打磨\\
有时添加，但更常减去

——《诗歌的艺术》（1674年）法国诗人、评论家Nicolas Boileau用这句话为作家的工作提出建议
